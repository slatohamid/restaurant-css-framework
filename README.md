# BeBurger Restaurant Website: üçîüíª

Let me give you the inside scoop on what I've been up to:

### Welcome Page
First impressions count, right? I set up a catchy "Welcome" page with a flashy Jumbotron and a couple of panels to showcase the latest buzz ‚Äì think promotions, events, and more.

### Menu
I designed a menu with lists of the BeBurger's using pagination also added some style with badges. 

### Pictures
For the "Pictures" page, I went all out with a gallery featuring more than 10 photos. And to keep things smooth, I added a slick pagination system ‚Äì 4 photos per page.

### Restaurant

### Contact
For the "Contact" page, I set up a user-friendly contact form.
